    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // are the same
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // are different
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;
    // are the same
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'Wesley';
    // are different
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // when you run 'players' and 'team' in the console, both arrays have taken 'Lux' at index 3.

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // hint: try 'players.slice()' in the console.
    // usually if you pass arguments to slice it will populate a new array with 
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    // Here we have successfully copied the array. The original data is unaltered
    
    // Another way of doing this is to create a new array and concat the old one in:
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Lax';

    // or we can use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Luke';

    // one last method to do this:
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Hee Haw';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
    };

    // The following won't work:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    // console log "person" and you'll see all that this did was make a reference to the original person object, not just the new captain object.

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // Object.assign: takes an empty object, the name of the object you want to copy, and the key/value pair you want to adjust or add.
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });
    // now log 'person' and 'captain2' and you will see the difference.

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
            twitter: '@wesbos',
            facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
        }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // this works (log 'dev')
    dev.name = 'Wesley';

    // This doesn't work (log 'dev' and 'wes'). It sets up a reference to the original object.:
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
